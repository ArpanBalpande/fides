# Releases

---

Each release version has a corresponding GitHub Project assigned to it. Issues are then assigned to them as a way to determine what new features/bug fixes will be included in each release.

Hotfixes are an exception to this and can be added and pushed mid-release as needed.

Fides uses semantic versioning.
